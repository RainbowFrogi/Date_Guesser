# Guess The Date

## This is a Javascript group project made at Metropolia UAS

## Description

The game works by presenting you with a picture of a random
location or an historical event from the years 1800 to 2024.
Your task is to guess the year by adjusting the year slider and
identify the country where the picture was taken. The closer
your year guess is to the correct date, the more points you
earn. However, for countries, you must guess the exact country
to earn pointsâ€”near guesses won't count.
